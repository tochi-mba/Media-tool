"""Router registry.

Adding an API means writing a router module and adding it here. Everything
cross-cutting -- problem+json errors, the request id, access logging, the version
prefix -- is inherited from the app factory, so a new endpoint starts consistent with
the existing ones rather than having to remember to be. See the recipe in AGENTS.md.
